/**
 * @title NFTRepairCentre
 * This contract is used to manage F1 Delta Time defunct tokens. Defunct tokens are NFTs which were created with an incorrect id.
 * As the core metadata attributes are encoded in the token id, tokens with an incorrect id may not be usable some in ecosystem contracts.
 *
 * This contract has two missions:
 * - Publish a public list of defunct tokens (through `repairList`) that ecosystem contracts relying on core metadata attributes can consult as a blacklist,
 * - Let the owners of the defunct tokens swap them for replacement tokens. Defunct tokens are sent to the `tokensGraveyard` when replaced.
 *
 * The owners of defunct tokens who want to use them in these ecosystem contracts will have to repair them first,
 * but will be compensated for their trouble with `revvCompensation` REVVs for each repaired token.
